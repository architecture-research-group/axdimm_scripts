#### Physical Address Range and Cache Size SP Occupancy Sensitivity Analysis

* start the antagonist in one shell
```
./antagonist.sh
```

* Configurables: 
(1) change the size of the src/dst buffers `#define SIZE (1<<29)`
(2) change the llc way allocation in each script before testing

#### Experiment Setup

* (1) Antagonist only: infinite loop copying a SIZE-sized buffer from a disjoint source to destination buffer
BUFFER SIZE-SWEEP(MB) and flushing:
128 -> 256 -> 512 shows SP occupancy increase
CACHE SIZE-SWEEP(Ways):
8 -> 4 -> 2 shows SP occupancy increase


#### Motivation
* We evaluate the scratchpad utilization when a thread performs compute copies of various sizes (various physical addresses ranges offloaded)
and with various CPU cache sizes (smaller cache size initiates LLC writebacks)
