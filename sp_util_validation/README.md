#### Allocates a src buffer and dst buffer With subtle (easily detectable) variations in the physical DRAM mapping
* microbench: program to test the SP entry alloc/free mechanism on AxDIMM
(1) allocates a src buffer, touches each cache line and issues a barrier s.t., all RdCAS commands are for the entire
buffer are seen in the memory before proceeding
    - Note: cache lines are not flushed as WrCAS's are not required. It has been experimentally observed that setting the buffer to ***volatile*** and touching a cache line is sufficient to initiate a RdCAS transaction
(2-a) allocates a dst buffer, touches each cache line to modify and bring data into cache
(2-b) flushes each cache line in the entire buffer to generate the full set of WrCAS commands
    - Note: the DRAM physical addresses corresponding to these WrCAS commands differs from those generated by the RdCAS commands for the src buffer in (1). Specifically, they map to a different bank group. ***By flipping both bank group bits from the WrCAS, the physical address corresponding to the RdCAS can be reconstructed in the memory***

#### build && run
```
make
./run.sh
```

***Goal***: choose pairs of Src and Dst Buffers whose physical DRAM mappings are equivalent aside from 1-2 bits
(1) Different Bank Address Same (BG, ..., Row, and Column)
* Choosing Src and Dst buffers with matching physical DRAM mappings aside from the ***BA*** bits:
(0x100000000, 0x100081200) -- how far does this matching mapping extend (i.e., all bits match with BG toggled)

tabulated pairs (xcel rows): (4307,8403) (4223, 8319), ..., 

##### Implementation
* Program Copies from a src buffer to a dst buffer whose addresses differ only in the BA field

* restrictions on source buffers:
    * source buffers must have a BA of 00

* restrictions on dst buffers:
    * must have a BA of 01
