#### Allocates a src buffer and dst buffer With subtle (easily detectable) variations in the physical DRAM mapping
* microbench: program to test the SP entry alloc/free mechanism on AxDIMM
(1) allocates a src buffer, touches each cache line and issues a barrier s.t., all RdCAS commands are for the entire
buffer are seen in the memory before proceeding
    - Note: cache lines are not flushed as WrCAS's are not required. It has been experimentally observed that setting the buffer to ***volatile*** and touching a cache line is sufficient to initiate a RdCAS transaction
(2-a) allocates a dst buffer, touches each cache line to modify and bring data into cache
(2-b) flushes each cache line in the entire buffer to generate the full set of WrCAS commands
    - Note: the DRAM physical addresses corresponding to these WrCAS commands differs from those generated by the RdCAS commands for the src buffer in (1). Specifically, they map to a different bank group. ***By flipping both bank group bits from the WrCAS, the physical address corresponding to the RdCAS can be reconstructed in the memory***
